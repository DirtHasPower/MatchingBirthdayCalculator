Packages:<br>
-random<br>
-time<br>

Parameter Info:<br>
-Sample Size(Recommended: 10000): amount of times to run the simulation. The higher the number, the more accurate the result. A large number will slow the process.<br>
-People: amount of people in "the room". To replicate original question, use 23. Large numbers will slow the process exponentially.<br>
  
-using 10000 and 23 should take less than 10 sec
