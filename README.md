Packages:
  random
  time

Parameter Info:
  Sample Size(Recommended: 10000): amount of times to run the simulation. The higher the number, the more accurate the result. A large number will slow the   process.
  People: amount of people in "the room". To replicate original question, use 23. Large numbers will slow the process exponentially.
  
  Note: using 10000 and 23 should take >10 sec
